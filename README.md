# tjspack

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tjspack is to assist in data cleaning for longitudinal study
datasets. Functions within are intended to ensure demographic data
doesnâ€™t change for subjects on different visits, dates visit numbers,
and ages are entered correctly. As well as checking if things are
correctly ordered chronologically

## Installation

You can install the development version of tjspack like so:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("tylerserm/tjspack")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which details how one can use the check_age
function. Note that for ID 1, the age is entered incorrectly on the
third visit
